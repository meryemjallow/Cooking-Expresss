# Cooking Express
Cooking Express is a website created for chefs and food lovers to view recipes and find meal inspiration. They can also submit their own favourite recipes for others to see.

The portal consists of: 
•	The homepage where users can see a selection of featured recipes 
•	 An about page
•	A page which displays user testimonials (Follower Comments)
•	Register and login pages that also allow external login (Google and Facebook)
•	A find recipe page which displays some pre-existing recipes. Users click on a specific recipe to view its instructions in a separate page, together with an embedded video showing the steps. If the viewer wants to see more recipes, they can do so by clicking on a link, but they must login first. This will take them to another page that allows them to see all the other recipes (the FindMoreRecipes page)
•	An add recipe page that enables a person to submit their own recipe and also displays the recipes that users have added in a table form. They can see the entire recipe from a link provided in the table. The add recipe page can be accessed only after logging in. From this page the user can also edit or delete a specific recipe. Some pages are automatically generated each time a new recipe is added by a user (edit- details - delete - recipe info’s)
•	A footer which exists in all the pages and contains the website’s social media icons, and the website author details (Amal and Mariama)



Project Details:
	This project is an ASP.NET MVC application that uses Entity Framework, implemented in the code first approach to create a database that stores all the recipes.
