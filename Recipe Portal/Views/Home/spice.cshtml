                    <br /><strong>Ingredients</strong><br />
                    1/2 lb. (1 cup) very soft unsalted butter; more  for the pan
                    1 cup very firmly packed light brown sugar
                    1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon
                    2 cups cranberries, fresh or frozen (thawed, rinsed, and dried), at room temperature
                    1 cup granulated sugar
                    1 large egg yolk, at room temperature
                    2 large eggs, at room temperature
                    2/3 cup sour cream, at room temperature
                    1 tsp. pure vanilla extract
                    1/2 tsp. table salt
                    7 oz. (1-3/4 cups) cake flour
                    1 tsp. baking powder
                    1/4 tsp. baking soda<br /><br />

                    <strong>Preparation</strong><br />
                    Put the remaining 12 Tbs. butter in a medium bowl. Using a wooden spoon, cream the butter with the granulated sugar and egg yolk until blended, about 20 seconds. Switch to a whisk and stir in the eggs one at a time. Whisk until the batter is smooth and the sugar begins to dissolve, about 30  seconds. Whisk in the sour cream, vanilla, and salt. Sift the cake flour, baking powder, and baking soda directly onto the batter. Using the whisk, combine the ingredients until the mixture is smooth and free of  lumps.
                    Spread the batter evenly over the cranberry mixture in the cake pan. Bake until the center of  the cake springs back when gently touched and a skewer inserted in the center comes out with only moist crumbs clinging to it, 50 to 65  min. Set the pan on a rack to cool for 5  to 10  minutes (the cranberry syrup in the bottom of the pan will be too thick if you wait longer). Run a knife between the cake and sides of the pan. Invert the cake onto a serving plate and remove the pan. Let cool for at least 15 min. more before serving. This cake is best served warm and fresh.
